# Setting up Angular CLI

Importantly Angular needs to be compiled (it is natively in Typescript) to run in the broswer on client side. Because of this Angular requires Node for development and production. We make use of the Angular CLI (via npm, which is installed via Node) to give us a project setup where all the dependancies/congiguration are dealt with.

We will add Node, Mongo and any other dependancies via the project. We make use of the Angular CLI development server for testing on localhost, however, this is not suitable for production (!!).  

Core dependancies:
- NodeJS
- Angular
- Angular CLI
- MongoDB
- Express
